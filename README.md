## Data Types
* `str` is an immutable fixed-length string in memory
* `String` is a growable, heap-allocated data structure. Similar to a `StringBuffer` in Java
* An *unsized type* is a type whose size is not known at compile time. `str` is an unsized type. `String` is a sized type (because it is a wrapper around `str`)
